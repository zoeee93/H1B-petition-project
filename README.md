# H1B Petition Analysis

As an international student, I am interested in the H1-B petition process by nature. I would like to know what kind of job is more likely to be certified with H1b, which company is more willing to provide H1b sponsor, and in which states or cities were the foreigners able to find jobs?

Moreover, this analysis is trying to identify the important factors that may affect the final status of H1-B Visa petitions, and predict the final status of the H1-B Visa petitions using various features. In this way, it provides a probability for both applicants and employers to predict the chances of being certified with H1-B visa and what aspects they should improve to increase their chances.

The project includes: plan, code, report and post.
